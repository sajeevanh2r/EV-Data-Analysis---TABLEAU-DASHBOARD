## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) population in the USA. The dashboard allows users to explore key trends, distribution, and characteristics of both **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)** through intuitive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs).

The aim is to offer quick, actionable insights into:
- EV market growth over the years  
- Geographical adoption patterns  
- Popular vehicle models and manufacturers  
- Clean Air Fuel Vehicle (CAFZ) eligibility status

## Key Features & Insights

### Interactive Filters
Located on the left sidebar, filters allow users to dynamically adjust the data displayed across the dashboard:
- **CAFZ Eligibility:** Filter by Clean Air Fuel Vehicle status  
- **EV Type:** Select BEV, PHEV, or All  
- **Model:** Drill down to specific EV models  
- **State:** Analyze data by US state  

### Core KPIs
The top section highlights critical metrics:

| KPI | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Total Vehicles** | 150,413 | Overall count of EVs (BEVs + PHEVs) in the dataset |
| **Average Electric Range** | 67.83 KM | Average electric range, indicating technological capability |
| **Total BEV Vehicles & %** | 116,745 (77.62%) | Number and percentage of BEVs, showing dominance of fully electric models |
| **Total PHEV Vehicles & %** | 33,668 (22.38%) | Number and percentage of PHEVs, reflecting hybrid market share |

   - Type: Line/Area Chart  
   - Purpose: Shows growth trend of EV population over time, highlighting peaks around 2022 (~37.1K vehicles).  

2. **Total Vehicles by State**  
   - Type: Choropleth Map  
   - Purpose: Displays EV registration density across US states.  

3. **Top 5 Total Vehicles by Make**  
   - Type: Horizontal Bar Chart  
   - Purpose: Highlights leading manufacturers like Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, BMW.  

4. **Total Vehicles by CAFZ Eligibility**  
   - Type: Donut Chart  
   - Purpose: Shows proportions of eligible, not eligible, and unknown vehicles.  

5. **Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model**  
   - Type: Table  
   - Purpose: Provides detailed view of popular EV models, including Make, EV Type, count, and % of total.
